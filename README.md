# Comunifi Tor + EURe Request Demo

Nostr + Crypto = ❤️

## Social Layer - Nostr

Usage of Nostr for the decentralized messaging layer. Nostr allows us to communicate in real time over a standard protocol. It also allows us to send json which can then be used to trigger on-chain actions.

## Blockchain Layer - Gnosis + ERC4337 Account Abstraction

Usage of the Citizen Wallet bundler to submit transactions.

## Desktop Client - Flutter

Run on your computer without needing permission from an app store to install.
